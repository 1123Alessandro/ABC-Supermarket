\section{Methodology}

% TODO: method

The standard workflow involves data analysis, preprocessing, modelling, evaluation. Apart from the \texttt{ID} column, all other data were fed into the model. There were a lot of preprocessing techniques used before the modelling, whichever were used and not used will be discussed in the experimentation section of the paper. For now, below are some of the preprocessing methods done on the data:
removing invalid values, removing null values, removing outliers, one hot encoding, interaction features, scaling, polynomial features

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Removing invalid values
% \item Removing null values
% \item Removing outliers
% \item One hot encoding
% \item Interaction features
% \item Scaling
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Modelling}

Various classification models have been compared with each other. The models tested are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and K-nearest neighbors

Modelling also involved cross-validation to ensure the consistency of the metrics.
