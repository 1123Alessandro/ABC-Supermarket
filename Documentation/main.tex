        ABC Supermarkets needs to do an analysis of whether or not their previous customers will accept their year-end sale of offering a gold membership for a cheaper price of \$499 compared to \$999 on the usual days. They wanted to know if their phone call campaigns would accepted by making a predictive model to classify which customers would purchase the offer. For implementation, logistic regression, support vector machines, naive bayes, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors models were used to evaluate the dataset. Models had undergone cross-validation to ensure the consistency of reuslts. It was found throughout all of the models that someone's year of birth, their purchases (regardless of at the store, online, or what did they buy), and their marital status had a play at determining if they would accept the offer.
